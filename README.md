- <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/"> Anaconda package</a>

#### Notes:

<i>review-score-model.ipynb</i> contains a linear model of feedback scores based on available quantitative and categorical features.

Jupyter notebook .ipynb files should render directly on github.

#### Results:

Current results of the review score model are as follows:

Mean Absolute Error: 2.44
Rsquared score-training data:  0.6722
Rsquared score-test data:  0.6564

In other words, 65.6 percent of the variance in the feedback review scores are explained by the model.
