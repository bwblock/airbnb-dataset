# airbnb-dataset

This project is an analysis of an Airbnb open dataset from the Seattle area found on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle"> here.</a>

The dataset has been provided under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CCO</a> Public Domain license

#### In the analysis we answer the following questions:

- <u>Question 1</u>: What is the distribution of property types in the Seattle Airbnb dataset?
- <u>Question 2</u>: What is the set of possible amenities and what does the distribution look like?
- <u>Question 3</u>: How do amenities correlate with the average guest feedback score for a listing?
- <u>Question 4</u>: Can we build a predictive model for review scores?
